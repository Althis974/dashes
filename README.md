# DASHES

# Introduction

  The dashes are projects available only for a limited amount of time. You can access to it
if you are present at the school and logged in. You will only have a little amount of time
to complete the dash from the moment the repo has been created.
Itâ€™s a little algorithmic project. After the time is up, it will be evaluated by the
moulinette. If you succeed, you will earn the xp associated to the dash.
